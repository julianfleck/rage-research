The same model that drives the landing figure, with its governing parameters exposed. Energy is injected at individual frames, fires across couplings, and decays; co-activated frames couple together (Hebbian) into membranes that form and dissolve. It is a sketch, not the substrate itself — the point is to give a feel for how a handful of rates produce exploration, stabilization, and drift.

Each control maps to one of the metrics used to read the substrate's health. Two of them — pull strength and rest length — are honest about being visualization controls: they shape how coupling *looks* on the canvas rather than measuring anything. The rest are the actual levers. Drag them and watch where the field lands between attractors that swallow everything and a substrate that fades to nothing.

The sensible regime sits where activation decay stays above coupling persistence: firing lingers and travels while couplings resolve, so subgraphs stay transient instead of freezing into permanent attractors. For the reasoning behind these dynamics, see the substrate-dynamics notes.
